### **Introduction for the DM**

This document contains sketches of the major and minor factions operating in Aerith. These are not meant to be rigid definitions, but rather inspirational springboards. Each faction has internal disagreements, hidden agendas, and the potential for both heroic and villainous actions. Use these as a toolbox to create compelling NPCs, complex situations, and to tie the player characters' actions to the wider world. The best stories will come from the gray areas where these factions' motivations overlap and conflict.

### **1\. The Triumvirate**

-   **Vibe:** Order at any cost. Gleaming chrome and rune-forged steel, crisp military uniforms, condescending politicians, and brilliant but ethically-flexible artificers. They see themselves as the reluctant but necessary saviors of a world descending into chaos. Their propaganda is inspiring; their methods are often ruthless.

-   **Key Figures & Archetypes:** High Artificer Kaelen (charismatic public face), Triumvirate Justicars (elite rune-armored soldiers), Subtle Hand Agents (spies and saboteurs).

-   **Motivations & Goals:** Re-establish the Concord under their control. Recover and hoard lost Concord-era runetech.

-   **Secrets & Opportunities:**

    -   **The Secret:** The Triumvirate's leadership believes the Great Discord wasn't an accident and are desperately seeking a "fix" that requires total control of the world's runic network.

    -   **The Hook for Your Player's Friend:** Her benefactor is likely a Triumvirate agent investing in her crew as a deniable asset. They've identified your character's dream connection and want to exploit it.

-   **Internal Dissent:** A growing faction of military traditionalists within the Triumvirate believes High Artificer Kaelen's focus on ancient tech is a dangerous obsession, advocating for more conventional military conquest instead.

-   **Relationships:**

    -   **Free Concordance:** Dangerous idealists who champion a chaos they call "freedom." To be absorbed, peacefully or otherwise.

    -   **Horizon Guild:** Useful, greedy tools. Their network is a valuable asset to be manipulated, but their neutrality is an obstacle to be eventually removed.

    -   **Keepers of the Choir:** Dangerous cultists meddling with powers they don't understand. Their "research" and their members must be contained and studied.

    -   **The Rusted Fleet:** Vermin to be exterminated. A useful boogeyman to justify their military expansion.

### **2\. The Free Concordance**

-   **Vibe:** A messy, vibrant, and fiercely independent coalition. A patchwork alliance united by a single principle: never again will they bend the knee. They are the scrappy rebels, but their disunity is their greatest weakness.

-   **Key Figures & Archetypes:** Skymarshal Eva Rostova (pragmatic military leader), The Free Trader (independent skyship captains), Silverwood Sages (arcane and spiritual advisors).

-   **Motivations & Goals:** Preserve the sovereignty of every member city-state. Establish and protect free trade routes.

-   **Secrets & Opportunities:**

    -   **The Secret:** The alliance is fragile. Several key members are secretly in talks with the Triumvirate, willing to trade freedom for security.

    -   **The Hook:** The players could be hired to protect a diplomat, run a blockade, or rescue a captured agent who knows of the secret negotiations.

-   **Internal Dissent:** A powerful "War Hawk" faction, led by Skymarshal Rostova, believes a pre-emptive strike against the Triumvirate is the only path to survival, while the "Doves," primarily the Sages of Silverwood, advocate for a diplomatic and defensive posture.

-   **Relationships:**

    -   **The Triumvirate:** Tyrants cloaking their ambition in pretty words. The single greatest threat to a free Aerith.

    -   **Horizon Guild:** Necessary but untrustworthy partners. Their commitment to profit over principle makes them unreliable allies.

    -   **Keepers of the Choir:** Misguided souls, pitiable but harmless. Some Sages, however, are deeply interested in their claims of a "song" in the Wastes.

    -   **The Rusted Fleet:** A plague on the skies. Proof that without a code, beings become monsters.

### **3\. The Horizon Guild**

-   **Vibe:** Professional neutrality and the freedom of the open sky. The Guild is a sprawling organization of merchants, explorers, and skyship crews who go where the money is. Their only true loyalty is to the contract.

-   **Key Figures & Archetypes:** Guild Factors (administrators and information brokers), Prospector Captains (daring explorers), Cartographers of the Winds (mystic navigators).

-   **Motivations & Goals:** Keep commerce flowing and stay profitable. Maintain their independence and control over the skies.

-   **Secrets & Opportunities:**

    -   **The Secret:** The Guild's leadership maintains a secret Concord-era communication network, giving them unparalleled intelligence which they use to play both sides.

    -   **The Hook:** A simple cargo run could be a cover for transporting a refugee, a piece of dangerous tech, or an agent. The Guild is the best bet for finding a map to a Lost Ark.

-   **Relationships:**

    -   **The Triumvirate & Concordance:** Their two biggest clients. Their war is a goldmine of opportunity, but if one side wins decisively, it could mean the end of the Guild's independence.

    -   **Keepers of the Choir:** Eccentric clients. The Guild has been hired to transport strange artifacts for them and discreetly acquire property near the Wastes. No one asks why.

    -   **The Rusted Fleet:** A direct threat to business. The Guild places massive, open-ended bounties on Rusted Fleet captains.

### **4\. The Keepers of the Choir**

-   **Vibe:** A fringe spiritual order, seen by most as a bizarre cult of Waste-touched mystics. Quiet, secretive, and intense. They don't see the Wastes as a wound, but as a new and misunderstood form of life.

-   **Key Figures & Archetypes:** The Listener (Waste-touched leader), Choir Acolytes (recruits with abilities like the player's).

-   **Motivations & Goals:** Understand the Silent Choir and help the nascent consciousness within the Wastes to be "born." Protect Waste-touched individuals from persecution.

-   **Secrets & Opportunities:**

    -   **The Secret:** The Silent Choir is real---the nascent consciousness of the shattered Nexus Stone. They believe your player character's dreams are its attempts to communicate, marking her as a potential prophet.

    -   **The Hook:** They will seek the player character out, either as allies offering answers or fanatics trying to claim their chosen one.

-   **Relationships:**

    -   **The Triumvirate:** The Great Enemy. They see the Wastes as a disease to be cured and would dissect anyone Waste-touched for their secrets.

    -   **The Free Concordance:** Indifferent. They leave the Keepers alone, which is the most that can be asked for. The Sages of Silverwood show a concerning level of interest, however.

    -   **The Horizon Guild:** A means to an end. Their discretion is useful for acquiring supplies and moving acolytes without drawing attention.

    -   **The Rusted Fleet:** They are part of the Wastes' chaotic song---violent, but a natural expression of the new world. To be avoided, but not judged.

### **5\. The Rusted Fleet**

-   **Vibe:** The fury of a forgotten people. Their skyships are brutal patchworks of salvaged hulls and overcharged engines, bristling with scavenged weaponry. They are a nomadic nation of raiders, descendants of military garrisons abandoned in the wilds after the Discord. They live by a simple, brutal creed: what you can take is yours.

-   **Key Figures & Archetypes:** The War-Chief (leader of the largest fleet, chosen by combat), Rust-Priest (mechanic-shamans who commune with dying engines), The Unchained (berserker shock troops).

-   **Motivations & Goals:** To survive and grow stronger. To burn the "soft" cities of the Concord that abandoned their ancestors. They revere strength and see raiding as a sacred act.

-   **Secrets & Opportunities:**

    -   **The Secret:** The Fleet is not as savage as it seems. They have a rich oral history and a deep, spiritual connection to the wilds. Some of their Rust-Priests have learned to navigate the *edges* of the Weeping Wastes by listening to the magnetic chaos, a skill no one else possesses.

    -   **The Hook:** The players might be shipwrecked in the wilds and forced to treat with them. Or, they may be the only ones who know the location of a crashed Lost Ark that lies just inside the Wastes---a prize they would die to protect.
