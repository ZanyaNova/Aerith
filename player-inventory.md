**Elias's Ledger** 
*A plain, hand-sized book bound in soft, unmarked black leather. The cover is worn smooth at the corners from frequent, discreet handling, and a simple leather thong wraps around it to keep it shut. Inside, the pages are thin vellum, filled from edge to edge with a tiny, precise, and heavily coded script. A quick glance reveals the names of prominent city figures, followed by dates, cryptic symbols, and notes on what you recognize as fears, debts, and points of political or personal leverage. The book is a meticulously organized encyclopedia of secrets, its value measured not in gold, but in power and ruin.*
