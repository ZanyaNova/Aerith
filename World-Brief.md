### **The Big Picture**

Welcome to Aerith, a world living in the long shadow of a fallen golden age. Generations ago, the Concord of Aerith united the continent under a banner of prosperity, powered by a celestial network of Nexus Runes that channeled the world's ambient magic. But a cataclysm known as the Great Discord shattered this unity, leaving a magically ravaged wasteland through the heart of the old empire---the Weeping Wastes.

Today, civilization clings to mighty city-states and fledgling kingdoms, each powered by their own lesser Runestones. These bastions of order are separated by vast, untamed wilds and the ever-present threat of the Wastes. Life and commerce depend on the daring crews of rune-powered skyships, who chart the unstable skies between settlements. The air is thick with ambition, the hum of runetech, and the echoes of a forgotten, grander time. The central conflict of this age is a cold war of ideology: should the world be reunited by force to reclaim the glory of the past, or should the hard-won independence of its new nations be protected at all costs?

### **The Concord that Was: A Faded Memory**

The Concord is now more myth than history. Sages speak of an age when skyships flew in perfect formations between gleaming cities, guided by the flawless light of the Nexus. Magic was a utility, as common and reliable as clean water, woven into the very fabric of society. The Nexus Runes, artifacts of immense power and unknown origin, were the heart of this empire. They regulated the seasons, calmed the wild spirits of the land, and connected the minds of its citizens in a gentle, empathetic web. It was, by all accounts, a paradise. But like all stories of paradise, it has an ending. The capital, Aethelburg, now lies in ruins at the epicenter of the Wastes, a ghost city of crystal and sorrow.

### **The Scar of the World: The Weeping Wastes**

The Great Discord was the cataclysm that ended the golden age. For reasons lost to time---be it hubris, an external attack, or a flaw in the Nexus itself---the central Nexus Stone in Aethelburg overloaded and detonated. The resulting explosion didn't just level a city; it tore a hole in the fabric of magic itself.

This wound across the continent is the Weeping Wastes.

-   **A Land of Chaos:** The Wastes are an ever-shifting landscape of raw, untamed magic. Gravity can invert without warning, the ground can crystallize and shatter, and rivers of pure energy flow through petrified forests. The sky above is a permanent aurora of violent, beautiful light, making navigation by the stars impossible.

-   **Echoes and Spirits:** The land is haunted by the psychic echoes of the millions who died in the Discord. These are the spirits that might be troubling your dreams---confused, angry, and twisted by the chaotic magic of the Wastes into something new and dangerous. Strange magical beasts, born from this chaos, are the apex predators here.

-   **The Wastes' Touch:** Those who live in the cities and towns on the edge of the Wastes are often changed by its influence. This "Waste-touched" condition can manifest as minor magical boons (a natural talent for sensing magical energy, an affinity for a certain element) or strange maladies (patches of shimmering skin, hearing the whispers of the Wastes on the wind, prophetic but agonizing nightmares).

-   **Crossing the Uncrossable:** Navigating the Wastes is considered suicide. The chaotic magic scrambles compasses and fries runic engines. Only one known route exists to bypass it: the Northern Sky-Bridge, a single, stable teleportation gate that skirts the very edge of the Wastes' influence. It is a heavily fortified and politically charged chokepoint, controlled by the northern city-state of Oakhaven.

### **Life Among the Shards: The Present Day**

The inheritors of the Concord's legacy live in a world of stark contrasts.

-   **Daily Life and Culture:** For most, life is defined by the hum of the local Runestone. It powers the street lamps, purifies the water, and fuels the engines of industry and defense. Children are taught to read runes as they are taught their letters. Skyship crews are seen as folk heroes, bridging the vast distances between cities. A common blessing is "May your skies be clear," and a curse is "May your compass spin." Ancestor veneration is common, especially for those whose lineage traces back to the Concord, seen as a link to a better time.

-   **The City-States:** Dozens of independent city-states dot the landscape, each powered by a major Runestone. They are fiercely independent and culturally distinct. Notable cities include: **Port Valoria**, a bustling trade hub built on the hulls of ancient warships; **Bastion**, a militaristic city-state carved into a mountain, guarding the western plains; **Silverwood**, a city grown in harmony with a great forest, home to renowned arcane academies; and **Oakhaven**, the grim, fortified gatekeeper of the Northern Sky-Bridge.

-   **Rune-Punk:** Technology is a fusion of machinery and enchanted runes. Skyships are held aloft by humming crystals, artificers forge weapons that can channel elemental energy, and couriers deliver messages through linked sending stones. Runic energy is powerful but can be unstable, and the knowledge of how to create new Runestones has been lost. The existing ones are precious, finite resources.

-   **The Great Game:** The two largest political powers are the **Triumvirate**, a coalition of three powerful western city-states pushing for a forceful reunification of the continent, and the **Free Concordance**, a loose alliance of eastern states dedicated to preserving their sovereignty. Their conflict is fought not on battlefields, but through espionage, trade wars, and proxy conflicts, often hiring skyship crews for deniable operations.

### **Mysteries & Legends**

Whispers and tales that could be story hooks:

-   **The Sky-Whales:** Enormous, majestic creatures that "swim" through the upper atmosphere, seemingly made of living light. Old sailors' tales say they are the original guardians of the skies, and that they weep for the broken world. Are they sentient? Where do they come from?

-   **The Silent Choir:** Some Waste-touched individuals claim to hear a "song" within the chaotic whispers of the Wastes---a beautiful, coherent melody that seems to hint at a consciousness within the chaos. Most dismiss this as madness, but what if it's the shattered Nexus Stone trying to heal itself?

-   **The Lost Arks:** Legend says that before the Discord, the Concord launched several "Arks"---massive vessels containing libraries of knowledge, stores of pure runic energy, and the secrets of the Nexus network. They were sent to remote locations for safekeeping. None have ever been found. Finding one could change the balance of power in the world forever.
