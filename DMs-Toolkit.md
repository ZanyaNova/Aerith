### **DM's Toolkit: The World of Aerith**

This document is a collection of modular ideas---creatures, people, and problems---to make the world feel alive and reactive. These can be dropped into any city or region as needed to create texture, offer side-quests, or introduce recurring characters.

### **1\. The Street-Level View: Sights, Sounds & Dangers**

**Common Technology & Runes:**

-   **Glimmerstones:** Fist-sized, enchanted crystals emitting a soft, steady glow.

-   **Courier Drakes:** Small, winged reptiles bio-engineered to carry messages via runic signals.

-   **Heatsinks & Cold-Coils:** Runic plates for basic climate control in homes and skyships.

-   **"Canners":** Street-food vendors using heat-runes to flash-cook food.

**Creatures of the Sky & Wastes:**

-   **Sky-Manta:** Large, docile filter-feeders that drift on the upper air currents.

-   **Scrappers:** Vicious, pack-hunting creatures with metallic beaks drawn to failing runetech.

-   **Glimmerwing Moths:** Large moths whose wings collect and refract magical energy, glowing hypnotically during Blightfall storms.

-   **Ruin Crawlers:** Crystalline, spider-like constructs from the Concord-era, now acting as mindless, aggressive guardians of ruins.

**Faction Footprints (How you know who's in town):**

-   **The Triumvirate:** Justicars patrol in pairs, their armor polished and identical, their movements synchronized. They don't speak unless necessary. Their presence makes a street tense and quiet.

-   **The Free Concordance:** You don't "see" the Concordance as much as you feel it. It's the loud debates in taverns, the variety of ship flags in the sky-docks, and the notice boards papered over with competing job offers, manifestos, and advertisements.

-   **The Horizon Guild:** A Guild Factor is always well-dressed but practically, often seen checking a chrono or making notes on a data slate. Their sky-barges are unmistakable: functional, armored, and flying the Guild's balanced-scale insignia.

-   **The Keepers of the Choir:** Keepers travel alone or in small, quiet groups. They wear simple, layered robes of undyed fabric and often carry long, walking staffs capped with a single, unlit Glimmerstone. They are usually seen observing, listening, and rarely interfering directly.

**Local Customs & Superstitions:**

-   **"Spilling Salt":** In any port town, spilling salt isn't just bad luck; it's an insult to the sky and the sailors who navigate it. You're expected to throw a pinch of the spilled salt over your left shoulder "to blind the gremlins in the rigging."

-   **"Coin for the Fallen":** It's common practice to leave a small coin on the threshold of a newly discovered ruin or shipwreck as a token of respect for those who were lost, a plea for the spirits within to rest easy.

-   **Ringing the First Bell:** In many frontier towns, the first person to spot an approaching skyship rings a loud bell at the docks. This is considered a good omen, and the "First Ringer" is often owed a free drink by the ship's captain upon their arrival.

### **2\. Potential Allies & Recurring Characters**

-   **Captain Eva "Sureshot" Rostova:** A grizzled, freelance cargo hauler captain of *The Wandering Pelican*. Pragmatic and well-connected.

-   **Master Kaelen:** An exiled Sage with unorthodox theories about the Weeping Wastes being a conscious entity. A potential source of vital information about your character's dreams.

-   **"Nails":** A paranoid, Waste-touched information broker and tinkerer in Port Valoria whose body is partially fused with data-gathering crystals.

-   **Sergeant Borin:** A disillusioned Triumvirate Justicar torn between his duty and his conscience.

-   **"Rust-Hand" Joric:** A quartermaster for the Rusted Fleet who is more of a pragmatist than a zealot. He believes the Fleet's leadership is getting too reckless and is secretly willing to trade information, supplies, or even safe passage through pirate territory in exchange for goods or favors that strengthen his own position within the Fleet. He's not a friend, but his self-interest could be a powerful tool.

### **3\. Adventure Hooks & Rumors**

**Bounty Board Hooks:**

-   **"The Ghost Ship of the Grey Shroud":** A collector wants the ship's log from a legendary Concord-era vessel that vanished.

-   **"Drake-Fever in Oakhaven":** A magical plague is making courier drakes go mad. Find the source, natural or sabotage.

-   **"Rusted Fleet's New Weapon":** The Horizon Guild will pay a bounty to any crew who can sabotage a pirate warlord's newly acquired sonic cannon.

-   **"The Whispering Mine":** Miners have been driven mad by "whispering" crystals. Cleanse the mine for a stake in its profits.

-   **"A Sage's Folly":** Master Kaelen needs a crew for a dangerous research expedition to the edge of the Wastes during a Blightfall storm.

**Personal Stakes & Whispers:**

-   **"The Collector's Debt":** An old gambling debt has come due. A sharply dressed enforcer from a Port Valoria crime syndicate informs a character they either pay up an exorbitant sum or steal a specific, well-guarded racing skiff for their boss. The target skiff belongs to Jax, your old rival.

-   **"A Familiar Tune":** You hear a fragmented melody being hummed by a traveler---a tune from a lullaby you thought only you and your family knew back in Dustfall. The traveler claims to have heard it from a strange, silent child who lives in a secluded Wastes' End orphanage.

-   **"The Justicar's Ledger":** You get a coded message from Sergeant Borin. He's discovered a logbook detailing a Triumvirate "pacification" of a frontier town years ago. The details are brutal and illegal, but the officer who signed off on the orders is now a powerful political figure. Borin can't leak it himself, but he can tell you where to find it.
