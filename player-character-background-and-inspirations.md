### **Core Backstory**

We grew up together in a frontier town on the edge of the Weeping Wastes, a place we'll call **"Dustfall."** Life there was hard, defined by the ever-present threat of Blightfall storms and the strange afflictions of the Waste-touched. Your nightmares began there, whispers and visions from the chaos just beyond the horizon. We shared a dream of escaping to the gleaming opportunities of the wider world.

When we were teenagers, something happened---an event we can define later---that forced us to flee Dustfall for good. We stowed away on a cargo skyship and made our way to the chaotic, vibrant city-state of **Port Valoria**.

In Port Valoria, we found our calling as "Rig-Runners" and skiff racers. We were a team, building our first racing skiff from scavenged parts in a forgotten dockyard workshop. We bonded through the thrill of the **Gale-Gamble**, the city's infamous storm race, and made a name for ourselves. But while the excitement was a balm for a time, it couldn't keep your nightmares at bay.

Seeking peace, you left the racing life behind for a quieter city, hoping distance from the Wastes would silence the dreams. Xenthia, however, doubled down. She thrived in the danger, becoming a local legend in the racing circuit, known for her daring and skill. It was this reputation that eventually drew the attention of her mysterious, wealthy benefactor. Now, she's come crashing back into your life, a new ship and a new mission in hand.

### **Inspirational People from Your Past**

-   **"Grease-Knuckles" Sal:** The old, grizzled mechanic in Port Valoria who took a liking to you both.

    -   **DM Secret:** Sal is more than he seems. He's a disgraced military engineer from the old Free Concordance fleet, hiding out from the Triumvirate. He saw a spark of his old captain in Xenthia and a rare gift in you. The parts he "found" for your skiff, the *Stray Dog*, were military-grade. He may have even installed a hidden long-range tracker or a secret system on it, "just in case."

-   **Jax:** Your fiercest rival in the Gale-Gamble.

    -   **Subversion/Secret:** The rivalry wasn't just about racing. Jax was a paid informant for the Triumvirate's Subtle Hand, tasked with identifying and testing promising pilots in Port Valoria's underworld. His aggressive tactics and "cheating" were calculated tests of your and Xenthia's abilities under pressure. He reported your success, which ultimately led to Xenthia's benefactor finding her.

-   **The Elder:** A Waste-touched seer from Dustfall who tried to help you understand your dreams.

    -   **DM Secret:** This Elder is a member of the **Keepers of the Choir**. They recognized your dreams as a true connection to the "Silent Choir." Their cryptic warnings weren't meant to scare you away; they were a clumsy, failed attempt to begin your initiation. The Keepers have been searching for the "girl who got away" ever since.

-   **Factor Koris:** A low-level Horizon Guild administrator who sponsored your first real race.

    -   **Subversion/Secret:** Koris isn't just a Guild member; he's on the Triumvirate's payroll. His "sponsorship" was a formal evaluation. He arranged for your first race to be against a particularly brutal set of opponents to gauge your potential. He's likely the one who passed your names up the chain to Jax's handler.

-   **The Dustfall Sheriff:** The law in your old hometown.

    -   **DM Secret:** The Sheriff didn't just help you escape; they covered up the real incident. One of your nightmares manifested physically---a burst of psychic energy, a brief localized warping of reality---that caused significant damage. The Sheriff, who owed your family a life debt, buried the report to protect you from the Triumvirate Justicars who investigate such "anomalies," sending you away for your own safety.

### **Inspirational Places from Your Past**

-   **The Petrified Tree:** The massive, crystalline husk of an ancient tree outside Dustfall where you sheltered during a Blightfall.

    -   **DM Secret:** This "tree" is not a tree. It's the fossilized nerve-cluster of a massive, ancient bio-mechanical creature from before the Discord. It acts as a psychic amplifier, which is why your nightmares became so vivid there. It might still hold a psychic "recording" of that night.

-   **"The Bent Rudder":** Your go-to tavern in Port Valoria.

-   **Docking Bay 94:** Where you built your skiff, the *Stray Dog*.

    -   **DM Secret:** "Grease-Knuckles" Sal still holds the lease. He keeps it as a shrine to you two, and maybe, a dead-drop location for his old military contacts. Your old skiff might still be there under a tarp.

-   **"The Grinder":** A nasty stretch of the Gale-Gamble race course.

### **Inspirational Moments from Your Past**

-   **The Real Reason We Fled Dustfall:**

    -   **DM Secret:** As noted above, one of your nightmares bled into reality. Maybe you shattered every piece of glass in a three-block radius with a psychic scream, or caused the well water to temporarily turn to shimmering dust. It was an uncontrolled manifestation of power that marked you.

-   **The First Victory:** The moment you won your first real purse in a race.

-   **The Crash:** A time one of you saved the other's life during a race.

    -   **DM Secret:** This wasn't an accident. Xenthia's engine failure was sabotage by Jax, on Koris's orders, to see how you'd react to a catastrophic failure mid-race. Your saving her is the exact moment you graduated from "promising racers" to "high-value assets" in the eyes of the Triumvirate.

-   **The Argument:** The fight you had before you left Port Valoria.

    -   **Subversion/Secret:** Xenthia wasn't just chasing glory. She was terrified of your nightmares and believed the only way to "fix" you was to earn enough money to hire a Sage from Silverwood or a Triumvirate mind-healer. Her daredevil racing was a desperate, misguided attempt to save you. She was too proud and scared to ever admit it. This is the secret reason she accepted her benefactor's offer: it promised a solution for you.
